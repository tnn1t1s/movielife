# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## 1. Start with Real-World Tension
The project began with a decaying civic sign—something both literal and symbolic.

## 2. Constraints as Creativity Engine
No added or removed letters—just reshuffled reality.

## 3. Balance Automation with Interpretation
Let machines generate. Let humans make meaning.

## 4. Design for Yourself First
The CLI is built for future reuse by the same creator.

## 5. Avoid Bloat
No features without purpose.

## 6. Think in Terms of Flow
Generate → Validate → Curate → Deploy

## 7. Build for Iteration, Not Perfection

## 8. Respect the Emotional Layer

## 9. Favor Interpretability

## 10. Extend Gently
Modular by design.
